# Cuvva logs

Simple logging system for generic, widely-understood logs.

Currently needs a way to integrate matching error codes to HTTP statuses but otherwise mostly fully-featured.

Also, maybe needs a way to allow easier info logging without having to create a new error code every time.

## Installation

```bash
$ npm install
```

## Running

```bash
$ npm start
```
